    /* i don't really know how to handle the gamefield part yet tbh...
    * IDEA
    * - the gameboard is on the top of the screen and then each player has their own dashboard below
    *   near the dashboard there is the mage image and then there is a popup menu for the expert card above the gameboard
    *   game info on the top right of the screen and a chronometer of the centre
    * - the gameboard is in the centre of the screen and then there is another scene just for the dashboard
    *   each player can see all the dashboard at once so that is more easy to understand the game situation and make strategy
    *   there still is a game info box on the top right of the screen, cuz i think it might be cute
    * - ...?
